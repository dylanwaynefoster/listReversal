# listReversal
Algorithm to print out a given list, then print it out in reverse order.

So I saw a coding challenge about reversing a list. That wasn't horribly difficult, but I added the stair-step print out to spice it up -- You're welcome! ;-)

I may add some user entry to the list; for now I just wanted to work on the algorithm and my Vim chops.

Thanks for checking it out!
